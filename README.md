# AceBook_PyJam
This is the group repo for PyJam (Aaron, Anne-Louise and Natasha)

## Team Charter

* Team PyJam will have a 10 minute catchup at 10am and 13:50pm daily to discuss where we are, what our next steps towards completion of Acebook are and how we are feeling the project is currently going.

* We have agreed to schedule the launch of coding our project at 14:00 4/2/20.

* We will be writing the front end of our project using templates from Bootstrap 4.4.1.

* We plan to feature freeze our code between 11/2/20-12/2/20. No further additions to our features that haven't begun will be added to our project at this point.

* There will be a code freeze on 13/2/20 to refactor and cleanup the back and front end.

* There will be a meeting on 14/2/20 (Time TBC) to go through the work we have completed and ensure there is a concise understanding across all members for the existence of all aspects the code.

**We agree to:**

1. Work as a team and support each other
1. Ensure there is a comprehensive understanding of the code each individual writes in the event of an absence
1. Not be afraid to ask for help, as we are all still learning and support each other
1. Treat every question with validity and respect

1. Actively share knowledge with team members
1. Have FUN! :)
